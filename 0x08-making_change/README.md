# Making Change

#### Change Comes From Within

Welcome to the "Change Comes From Within" problem! This task involves determining the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given total amount using a pile of coins of different values. The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to optimize the solution and minimize the number of coins used.

## Problem Description

Given a list of coin values and a target total, the goal is to find the minimum number of coins required to achieve the target total. If it's not possible to make the target total using the available coins, we return -1.

### Function Signature

```python
def makeChange(coins, total):
    pass
